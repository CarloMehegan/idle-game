# Unendangerer
An idle game for AP Comp Sci Principles

November - December 2019

## Goal
Collect food and energy to save endangered species!

## Directions
Mouse used for everything. Start by pressing the energy and food buttons. Cooldown buttons can be sped up by clicking fast. After unlocking workers, hire them with the + buttons. You need to have created an animal before you can hire it. 

Dragging workers into jobs will have them automatically produce specific resources. However, leaving them unemployed will allow them to join your journeys and will increase the power of the energy and food buttons.

There are eight different species of animals to save, and they're all extremely cute
